You have successfully created an Atlassian Plugin!

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

Full documentation is always available at:

**Note:** The dependencies versions we've picked are for compatibility only! We recommend you review the versions 
        and make sure they are not vulnerable and target the latest version of the product
